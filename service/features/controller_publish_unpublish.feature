Feature: VxFlex OS CSI interface
  As a consumer of the CSI interface
  I want to test controller publish / unpublish interfaces
  So that they are known to work

  Scenario: Publish volume with single writer

    And a valid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call PublishVolume with <access>
    Then a valid PublishVolumeResponse is returned
    And the number of SDC mappings is 1
